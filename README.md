# Data Analysis: Impact of Note-taking and Self-Transcription Strategies on EFL Vocabulary Acquisition

## Abstract

This repository contains data and analysis related to an ethnographic research study focusing on note-taking and self-transcription strategies in the context of English as a Second Language (ESL) acquisition. The study involved 18 high school students and implemented Task-Based Language Learning and Teaching (TBLT) theory (Doughty, 2003; Ellis, 2003; Willis & Willis, 2007) along with a pedagogic cycle for ESL note-taking (Siegel, 2015a; 2016). The research aimed to analyze the impact of these strategies on the ESL learning process, particularly focusing on the dynamism of the process, word frequency, and syntactic restructuring observed in participant productions.

### Keywords
